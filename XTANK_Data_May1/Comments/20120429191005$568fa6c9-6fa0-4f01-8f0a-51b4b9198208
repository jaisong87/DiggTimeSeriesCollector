The Irish?  Drink?  Clutch the pearls!!

As an American of Irish descent I'm surprised I survived college!
Cheers...(?)
Yup, our laws regulating substances are working soooo well.  Keep on voting for people who want to maintain the status quo (Obama & Romney) and keep on drinking that government Kool-Aid while our kids die in droves due to our own stupidity.  Our laws encourage drinking (and aim to prevent people from choosing safer and less addictive substances such as cannabis) while also creating corruption and violence via the Drug War.
Well, what do you recommend?
Youths get Addicted fast now.
As opposed to drinking government Kool Aid, I mean.
As I said on another post about marijuana....when did you last hear about any deaths or crimes being committed after smoking weed?

wtf how did pot get lumped into this? the rest of the article mentions nothing but binge drinking and they passively mention pot....
So ... since I made it this far - I'm good to go ?
This is very sad.
