Women's vote troubling but changeable.
Does it matter which one wins?  both in pocked of the banking cartel...
I see it as both are willing to implement poor monetary policy.

They are both willing to pass very poor policies and continue to 'run' the banks as they see fit.  The easy money loans to people who couldn't afford it was essentially mandated by our government.  There is no such thing as predatory loans, just horrendous government policy imposed on the banks in the form of regulation.

If banks had to make all decisions based on whether or not they were going to be paid when they lent out money, lets just say there would NOT have been the kind of housing crash/crisis we saw and are still feeling.

I just can't blame the banks when they were told in black and white how they were going to run their business.
