'A Downing Street spokesman insisted the prime minister was merely concerned to avoid cutting across the Leveson inquiry.'

Do they mean in the same way the Leveson inquiry was established to cut across police investigations?  Entertaining the Leveson proceedings may be, and it's true much of the preceding police work was seriously comprised, the inquiry now pre-empts and effectively postpones on-going investigations into allegations of criminal misconduct.  How convenient that must have seemed to the Prime Minister when he established the inquiry; and how misguided that must appear to him in retrospect.  Silly little man.
