How is this any different from the "we'll beat any competitor's price" promises made by the big box stores years ago?  All you had to do it bring in a receipt or a listed price in an ad and they'd match the price or give it to you for less.

Heck, Fry's does that now.

Yeah it's aggressive but... you voluntarily installed the plug-in... Is that any different than bringing a Fry's guy with you to Best Buy?  Or a car dealer agent with you to another lot?

This is REAL consumer power...
I run several plug-ins that modify code locally, removing advertisements; merging many pages into one web page etc etc.
I'm somehow meant to care that those massive companies that came into all these towns lowered priced driving local businesses that had been there decades, and raised the prices once the competition had died. have to compete fairly on the Internet.
exactly
