Roland Martin is an idiot and wants everyone else to live in his idiotic world. There's a reason why Democrats don't want voter ID laws (he keeps calling it voter suppression to show his bias). It's because this party can bus in people no matter who the hell they are. They've been doing it for decades and they are now in a panic because these laws will stifle their plot. The American electorate would be surprised by how much their votes have been negated by this illegal activity.
Yesss... yessss... the Republicans will do anything ANYTHING to steal an election!

Except use fake voters... they will never do that and all laws trying to prevent fake voting is just an evil Republican plot...
As a conservative I want no voter suppression.  I am curios, do the Prog.s feel the same about voter fraud?
Me: "Oh! Like when the Black Panthers touted automatic rifles and harassed all the white people? ... ... ... Oh, no, its a black guy on CNN complaining about the GOP. Go figure."
