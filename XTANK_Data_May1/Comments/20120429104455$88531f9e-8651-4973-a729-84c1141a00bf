What they need is a 'resort' style space station with nice suites that can be visited by folk on the spaceplane...an industry like that will have folk paying the big bucks for a week in space ;)
"houston we have a problem...we're uh hurling toward deep space at 5 times the speed of sound"
How many steps are there again?
off we go on a wild goose chase....
Even if this new engine would do as they suggest, this proposal does nothing to address the problem of heat during re-entry. And re-entry is as big a problem as geting into space cheaply, if not bigger!
Will they charge extra for checked in language?
"The 270ft Skylon spaceplane would take off and land from a conventional runway but fly 18 miles above the ground and out of the Earth's atmosphere at five times the speed of sound."

That's pretty neat but, 18 miles is still a long way from the edge of the atmosphere. 180 miles, maybe?
Actually, they've not forgotten about that; the craft will be covered in a ceramic composite.
It will be air breathing until it gets 18 miles up, then it switches to the on-board oxygen, presumably to take it further away.
