"There is something psychologically wrong here."

Tea-Baggies = Nucking Futs
You are accurate in your assumption.
I met some OWS today and they seemed mentally unbalanced.  There, fixed it for ya'.
I met some OWS people in Boston a few months ago, and they were screaming like monkeys who might be locked inside of a cage.  

I kind of a felt sorry for them.  They looked like they needed a flea dip.
That's exactly how I feel about novie and his screaming rants about DPs.  It must be sad to have that fake news story as the high point of your life.
Executive summary:  In a room with a dozen people some of them believed things that weren't true.
I've been fortunate enough never to actually encounter them directly, but I did hear some drumming once and saw enough Youtube videos to realize that the left has its share of delusional folks as well.
