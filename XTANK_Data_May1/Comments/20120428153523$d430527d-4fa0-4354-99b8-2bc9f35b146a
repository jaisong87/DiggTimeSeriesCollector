Mad skillz yo!
I like the No.1 point. i.e having coding skill.
I will also say designing skill is equally important as coding skill.
Except 1,2 and 3, I liked all suggestions. have no interest in coding, cooking and learning a new language.
This is a very good article. Promotes taking up a hobby.
I love learning new things, especially things I can use in everyday life, like how to repair stuff.  I think it's important to keep learning new things, whether just for fun, or for a specific purpose.
Fun with neon sign transformers.
Useful tips. I like points 5, 2 and 1, specially the second :)
