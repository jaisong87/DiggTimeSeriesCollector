I have a lot of friends and family that work for Ford. I'm glad to see them doing better in the US than before.
Feed me good news, pls
Great news for the only car company not to take the bailout.  Kind of makes the Dem.s look bad.
Don't buy a Ford Escort, its a total piece of crap car.   Interference engine with a rubber band for a timing belt, and a valve seat that drops out after 200,000 miles.   Not to mention a ton of sensors to go bad, and an engine packed in there like fishes in a sardine can... impossible to work on...   worst designed car... ever.

I have two words for Ford to beat into their thick idiot brains:    TOOL CLEARANCE.  If your auto cad program doesn't have a feature to automatically check to make sure you can get a tool in there, then something is wrong with your entire engineering department.

This is what I say: go to a junkyard, and look at the thousands of different junk cars... what lasts, what don't last, and mainly.. do we need 1000 different varieties of car, all of which have no parts in common?   Not even things that absolutely should be, like one size...  battery sizes, tire sizes, wiper blade sizes, or headlight sizes.
Not at all - Detroit as a whole (Chrysler, GM) are doing well - with GM having record profits.   Bottom line is the bailout worked and most republicans, especially Romney, opposed it.  They're the ones looking bad - Michigan is blue this election year and all the dems have to do is play a tape of Romney saying let Detroit go bankrupt.
At least we have one USA car company to be proud of.
