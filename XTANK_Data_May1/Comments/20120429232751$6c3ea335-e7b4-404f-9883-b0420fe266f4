The Democrat Way:  If you can't win honestly, cheat.
Setting up for the loss already I see. Hey, you got to blame someone or something. Or you could just accept the reality that more people are going to vote for Obama. Nah, I forget we're dealing with rightwingers here. Accepting personal responsibility for your failures isn't part of the narrative huh?
The Republican way? Google the name Mike Connell and his role in the 2004 Ohio results. For a more complete picture: Republican Faust: The Rise and Fall of Mike Connell - 1/3  http://shar.es/2oSk5

The reason people cheat is because they don't think they can win fairly. That won't be the case in November.
