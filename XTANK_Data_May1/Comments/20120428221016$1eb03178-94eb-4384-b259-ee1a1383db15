So then, I hate everything! So, there, take that!
This is just getting absurd. I may be wrong, but I don't agree with the court. Facebook *likes* should be protected by the first amendment.

I can't even believe I'm reading this or that this was a court issue.
And your speech should be protected, too.  I don't agree with the judge here.
Likes and unlikes are opinions, free speech are generally opinions therefore (IMO) likes and unlikes are free speech, I dislike the candidate choices of the upcoming election, so there!
Yes...but the First Amendment is not about keep a job. Free Speech is NOT free from all consequences.
It was. He was not persecuted. But no one has the RIGHT to work where they want. Free Speech has nothing to do with keep a job. Never has.
I think the title is misleading.  The judge ruled on the merits of the case, which weren't sufficient (there was not a preponderance of evidence) to support their claim.  It's more plausible that people indiscreet enough to post such opinions on facebook, of all places are probably indiscreet in other ways as well.  My guess is that their lack of support for their boss (and fellow cop) was telegraphed in all sorts of other ways.  Cops are trained observers and consummate students of non-verbal communication.   Moreover, solidarity among cops, for better or worse, is considered key and cops who publicly voice disapproval of their fellows are probably asking for involuntary career change.
If "likes" aren't protected speech because they don't contain any inherent comment, then we should reconsider "voting" as having any merit as well. A vote for a candidate is nothing but a formally presented "like."
