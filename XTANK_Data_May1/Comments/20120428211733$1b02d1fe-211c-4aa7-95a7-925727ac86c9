'Lying' ? He lied under oath about an extra-marital affair. It is not like he started illegal wars or something. You people really need to start seeing what is important for your country. Those illegal wars started by GW cost you your economy - Clinton's lying cost you a great president.

Partisan shrills, too stupid to know what is good for you and preferring to listen to a vile radio host and coke addicted tv personalities - you get what you deserve. I just feel for your fellow countrymen who have to suffer for your stupidity and ignorance.
