I don't think it's limited to tech companies, but I can tell you this: If you fix the loopholes, you'll suddenly see lots of U.S. HQ'd corporations suddenly move their headquarters to some other country that'll offer them a better deal. Whatever costs the corporation the least, will happen.
Not tech companies. the problem is that the tax system has too many weird twists and turns. Too may dodges. It needs to be more simple.
The law has not yet been written whose intent that some smart guy cannot mitigate by perfectly legal means. 

I also have some issures with the word "innovation".  It's much more rare than some politicians or corportate PR types would have you believe.  To me, it means a step change from the current way of doing things.  Product development, the gradual improvement of existing products, does not deserve the same moniker.  It occurs almost inevitably and regardless of any offical policies toward "innovation".
It's quite simple, the tax system needs to be refreshed. Too bad the politcal elements are too short sighted to see that an updated tax code would benefit everyone.
awesome
Everyone's greedy and doesn't give a shit about their county or the people in it. What happens when there are no jobs in America for people to earn enough money to buy this crap? Fuck it, I'm moving to China. 
Their trying to implement all these laws on internet piracy and bandwidth caps, but the taxing system is perfect and need no work. It's more important Hollywood gets their extra 10$ for a album then for the millions they should be paying in taxes. Go democracy!
