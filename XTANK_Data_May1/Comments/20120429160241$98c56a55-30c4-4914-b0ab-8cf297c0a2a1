The report is a wake-up call to voting rights advocates: Get moving to ensure everyone can vote -- time is running out -- the presidential election is just 28 weeks away!
Those groups are very well organised Texas needs help too, it's very hard to get picture ID here.  Funny too once one finds where to get a birth certificate and just give the names, pay the fees. It's ordered online, no one checks.
  Then go into the social security office with irs reports, a crapload of id and they demand college transcripts, that they open in their office to prove who you are. very  bizarre web the gop have woven.

  I wish we could take our vote out of local and state control, I'm very concerned about the bean counters integrity.
