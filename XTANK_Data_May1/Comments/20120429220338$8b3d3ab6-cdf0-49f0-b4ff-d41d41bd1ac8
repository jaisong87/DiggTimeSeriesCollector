Through several bills and court actions against the states the federal government has proven itself hostile to those values that we hold dear: Life, Liberty and Property (each a part of the Pursuit of Happiness). As Jefferson said so long ago: That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.

And so, here we are. Our government has become destructive of these ends. The Patriot Act has become the agent of harassment and invasion of privacy, of violating our principles. The DHS and TSA only fix a spotlight on the abuses of government, but there are so many ways in which the government has long sought to bring us under control, demand of us our liberty and dictate our thoughts. It is to a point where their legitimacy is gone.
