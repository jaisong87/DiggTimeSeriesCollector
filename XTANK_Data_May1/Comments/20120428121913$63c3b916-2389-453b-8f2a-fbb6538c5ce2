Yes, we can give all cash and earnings to those already wealthy, or VOTE FOR OBAMA and have hope of a job that is not a minimum wage salary that is taxed at a higher rate!
A vote for Obama means giving your tax dollars to his cronies for their failed businesses.
Being one of those with a job today, and job offers pending.  I am much happier under Obama.  I do wonder, since Romney has already laid out his "help for the wealthy" plan if any of those already wealthy will turn out to be "his cronies", and how many companies did BAIN bankrupt or send overseas?  Just a question for you.
