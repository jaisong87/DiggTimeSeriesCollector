Damn! I have been taken a back by these lovely sights in Chicago. Chicago is the new city on my wish list.
I still don't know why they call it the Windy City seems about right to me
apparently San Francisco is part of Chicago now
Proud to live here
They call it the Windy City because of the incredible stream of hot air emitted by our politicians.
You didn't know that they moved the TransAmerica Building to Chicago? Neither did I.
Everyone from Chicago knows there are no hills, mounds, or piles of earth of any kind in Chicagoland. Period. Beautiful collection of photos, but one of those pictures is not like the others...
