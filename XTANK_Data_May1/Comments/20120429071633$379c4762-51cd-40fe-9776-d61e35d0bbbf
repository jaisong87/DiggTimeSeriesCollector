So you're saying you have no clue about camping LOL as well as you had fun that's what counts came back home in one piece, survived the elements with geared pop-up trailer and propane heater canned food etc. etc. did you have a hair dryer also LOL that's what I call roughen it if you didn't take the hair dryer  lol
Camping is almost always a rolling nightmare.
This approach to camping is utterly alien to me.  You're fiddling all night with a propane heater which you don't understand, because your sleeping bags are too feeble to take you to 40 degrees Fahrenheit?  That's not even freezing.  Why aren't you prepared for something so basic?  Or are you hoping to become an object lesson in natural selection?
Lame "article."
I suggest the author confine his future "camping" experiences to a vehicle with insulation.
