I hope this bitch burns.  3 years?  pftt.  she should get attempted murder and life in prison.  pulling all of someones teeth is a potentially life threatening procedure, most of the time they have to do it in multiple sessions.   the entire dentists office should be sued for millions, since there should have at least been an assistant there for such a procedure.
I'm not sure she should get charged with attempted murder, but she should lose her license, serve prison time, and a jury should happily award the plaintiff whatever he asks for in damages.
Not that he's stupid or anything, I mean, dump a woman and then put your life in her hands.
whoever came up with this headline sucks. and she sucks. the guy didn't deserve it at all, and nobody should be so evil. you can find another boyfriend. you honestly just put yourself in the position, in my book, for execution. you are fucking dangerous.
I believe in Karma,maybe in Prision someone WILL knockout her teeth Out, pretty mess up,huh
Hey honey I'm dumping you but BTW could you do that root canal for me anyway?
I agree to that "Not that he's stupid or anything, I mean, dump a woman and then put your life in her hands." If one won't be careful against his ex girlfriend or ex boyfriend, against whom he or she would be careful. This of course doesn't mean she is innocent. It only means he is stupid.
maybe he thought she took it well enough
If she gets 3 years in prison,looses her license, and gets sued she's still getting off easy.
She's lucky the guy did not shoot or stab her after doing this.
Not very professional..... Maybe needs hormone replacement!
That was her mutilating his body. IF the roles were reversed I'm sure the article and TITLE would be very different.

I wonder if they have community service in Poland.
well he sure cannot chew so sucks he does
 should be a Poland tag
