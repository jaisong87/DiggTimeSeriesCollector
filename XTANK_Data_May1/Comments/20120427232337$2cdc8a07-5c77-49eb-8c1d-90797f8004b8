I remember a time when what happened at secret service party was secret :P
the question is... why not?
Married, dating or soliciting prostitutes.  All men pay for sex in one way or another.
Because it can be bought!
All men always pay for all sex. Sometimes I guess some men just want to skip all the pomp and circumstance and make it a direct cash transaction.
I remember a time when secret service people paid for services.
You are wrong on the 'all'.
virgins
Umm instant gratification?
That's so quote worthy!
Title is misleading.  It should say "Why [Some] Men Buy Sex."  According to the article, only about "2 percent to 4 percent of American men have visited a prostitute in the last year."
I agree with your statement except men don't always pay for sex with cold, hard cash.  There are other forms of payment...like a piece of your soul.
That's a Faustian deal if ever I heard one.
The real story here is why FOX only talked about this nonsense and didn't say the secret service was there because there was a summit in which every latin country was against the USA for not lifting the ban to Cuba.
