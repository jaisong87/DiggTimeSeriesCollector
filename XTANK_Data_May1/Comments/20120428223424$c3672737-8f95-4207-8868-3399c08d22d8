The United States government will sell anything to anyone as long as the upper hand is there's. Remember war is money, lots of it.
I agree with truth1freedom, what better way to help keep China in check and to make money at the same time.
Since 60 fighters isn't going to give any appreciable advantage to Taiwan I think this move is more symbolic.  It is probably a counter-move to China's continued resistance on issues like Syria, Iran and N Korea.

The shift in position coincides with the confirmation of Mark Lippert, a former aide to President Barack Obama, to the post of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Security Affairs.
Taiwan's navy is in much worse shape.  They could use new submarines to counter a Chinese naval invasion.  Also, F-16's won't cut it.  China will ballistic missile bombard Taiwan's runways.  Taiwan will never get F-35Bs from the US, but they probably should be trying to get Grippens from Sweden; a plane capable of almost STOVL operation.
