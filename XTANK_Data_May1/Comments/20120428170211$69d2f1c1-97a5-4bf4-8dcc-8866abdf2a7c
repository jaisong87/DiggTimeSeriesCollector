wow awesome article
This article sins in circles. Nothing gained by reading it, and it's such a good topic to discuss too.
Off the topic of gaming but it is mentioned in the article. Adobe is offering their entire CS6 catalog and access to the new cloud service for $50 a month, that is by far one of the most reasonable deals I have ever come across and will put a stop to my piracy. I have purchased some versions (back when AE was $2500 by itself) and pirated others. I would gladly pay a game company a monthly fee to play their games, I tried onlive for a while but I didnt like the low resolution streaming. I pay less than $50 a month on steam right now but if the let me play unlimited games I would pay that $50 every month. Way to go Adobe!
