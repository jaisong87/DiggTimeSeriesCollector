Had to follow a couple links to get to the actual photos, but they are quite amazing.  Would have loved to be alive during that time.  I know my path in life would have been drastically different.
Hate following links to get the photos, once a got there they were quite nice
I agree with you, I wish the photos were available on the landing page of the link provided. Many more people would be able to find them then.

Gemini was a great program. I only watched one Gemini launch at the Cape, while nothing like a Saturn launch, it was thrilling to see. Gemini flights were frequent with 10 missions between the spring of '65 and end of '66.
