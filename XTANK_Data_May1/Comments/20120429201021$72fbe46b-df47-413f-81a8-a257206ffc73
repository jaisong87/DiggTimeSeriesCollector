So we continue to live in the dark ages of drug prohibition
Not quite Dark Ages - more like a Feudal system in which we "uneducated peasants" aren't allowed to question the "enlightened (and corrupt narcissistic) masters"
You know, I just am stunned by this.  Amsterdam has so long been a beacon of tolerance and good humor among a world tainted with excessive laws and rules.

I sure hope they vote their way back to their open-minded ways.
Dumb move this is going to devastate their tourism industry but then prohibitionists are incapable of comprehending repercussions of their actions.
