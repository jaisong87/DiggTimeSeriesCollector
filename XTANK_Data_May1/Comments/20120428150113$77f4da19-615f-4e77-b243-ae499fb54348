Too late Mitt.

The modern Conservative movement has defined itself for decades to come.  Your Etch-a-Sketch efforts won't do you or any other Republican any good.  The country ALREADY knows you and your ilk are pathological liars.

Personally, I don't see why ANY evangelical "Christian" or Catholic would dare to support the Republican/Tea party's ongoing wickedness or Paul Ryan's (R-WI) poverty inducing budget/agenda.
