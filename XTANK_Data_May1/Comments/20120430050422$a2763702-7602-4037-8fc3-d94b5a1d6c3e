Now take your SLEAZY PORN and shove it up your ass.
The words that you wrote in the order that you used don't make any sense so I am just guessing at what you were trying to say but: You don't have to induct people to sexuality, that stuff pretty much takes care of itself and pretending that sex doesn't exist doesn't actually make it stop existing.

As described the animation is not really suitable for 9 to 11 years old but from educational point of view those are OK from 15-18 years

"The Daily Mail makes money from posting pictures of scantily-clad women on the internet. Sometimes these women are topless. Sometimes they are completely naked. Often the images are captioned with breathy descriptions of 'cleavage', 'dangerous curves', 'thigh-skimming' dresses. Sometimes the images are of disturbingly young girls, accompanied with phrases like the infamous 'all grown up.'"

The Daily Mail is a POS, trashy, rightwing tabloid.

That's too bad, because in order for sex ed to actually have some fucking value, it has to occur BEFORE kids start having sex. Since by 15 more than 25% of kids have already had intercourse, that means education needs to occur earlier.
Actually, only 13% of students reported having sex before 15 and sexual intercourse among teenagers has declined since 1995.
