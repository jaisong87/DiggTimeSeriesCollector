How pitiful.
This article seems to be on the right track, but somehow can't get any traction.  That's not too surprising.  After all, how much wisdom can anyone possibly accumulate when they've barely started to explore adulthood?

The key to wonderful relationships is quite simple in essence.  If you take responsibility for becoming a complete person and meeting your own emotional needs, the rest naturally follows.  The great relationships in your life are the ones which in one sense or another reflect this insight.

If you want to "take ownership of the story arc" or whatever, that's great.  Go for it.  But I'm willing to claim that any relationship story which doesn't help you to gain insight into the nature of completeness is not serving you but distracting you.  Take your choice.
Not a bad article at all, make sure wonder when people say the love of my life, what a joke, anyway I don't know why people even get married, she just go out on the street find a woman that hate your guts and give her your house.. LOL
