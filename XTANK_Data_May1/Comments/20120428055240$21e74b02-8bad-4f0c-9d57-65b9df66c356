Then Ryan should be "protecting both SS and Medicare" as Ayn Rand went broke and had only those 2 social programs to keep herself alive.  It seems Ryan loves her books and hate, but has no respect for the programs, she herself NEEDED ENOUGH TO USE THEM.
Does this mean he isn't going to require people to read the Rosenbaumian adolescent screed. "Atlas Shrugged",  as a condition of employment any longer ( http://nymag.com/print/?/news/politics/70282/index1.html )?OR is Ryan still forcing it but denying that it holds meaning?
Funny, that's what Novenator did to Obama...
Oooo you haz a crush on Nov! You're so obsessed. He has a girlfriend though. Sorrrryyy!
Ooooh you haz a girl crush on Quirkopatra!  You're so obsessed.  She has a boyfriend though.  Sowwwyyy...

So would you like to discuss Novie's propagandistic hypocrisy towards Obama?

Oh wait... what am I saying... look who I'm talking too!
Rand was certainly prophetic in showing us how the Prog.s think and act, wanting to control every facet of everyone's life.
awww, lots of digg downs but no arguments.  Is my logic that flawless?
It's OK if you want to come out of the closet skywise.  That's fine.  I get it.  You're obsessed with me.  I'm flattered, but as noted before, I'm straight, and even if I was gay, you're really not my type.
Ahh... using homosexuality as an attack method...

your hateful bigotry is coming through again..
But hey while I gotcha here... isn't it true that you've etch-a-sketched(tm) your devotion to Obama?

Because I notice you couldn't be bothered to respond to the OP but had to divert.
