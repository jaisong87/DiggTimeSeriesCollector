FTA:

"Gasoline cost $1.84 per gallon in January 2009 when Barack Obama entered the White House."

Sheesh. You mean because of the price crash that happened THREE MONTHS BEFORE INAUGURATION DAY?

Notice that the curve remains the same, and that we still haven't hit the prices before that three-month crash.

The zeitgeist seems to be "gas pricing is following the same pattern that it did under the Bush administration and other administrations before it! Thus Obama is obviously a failure!"

If the science of gas pricing is actually new to some people reading this, then God bless you. Now, can you focus on an actual *valid* criticism of the current administration? There are plenty... take your pick.
