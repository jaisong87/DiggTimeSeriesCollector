There needs to be a better way to bridge job seekers with job creators. I always hear about companies having hard times hiring and I'm like wtf?
It's not that they have a hard time hiring, it's that many companies either prefer hiring overseas or have adopted unrealistic employment expectations.  I don't buy their complaints, especially since their overseas hiring rates are TRIPLE what one sees in the U.S.

If most companies were genuinely interested in hiring in the U.S., they would find a way to make it happen.
Here is a company that is trying to bridge that gap: http://berlinstartupjobs.com/ That's where I found my job at http://basecase.com/
