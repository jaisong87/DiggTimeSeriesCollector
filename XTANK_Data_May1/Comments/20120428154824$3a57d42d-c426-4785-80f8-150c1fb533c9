Two excellent strategies, both of which hardly need a lot of push from the Left or Center.  Anyone who reads should recognize Romney as someone who does not understand the average American, whose silver spoon birth contributed to his lack of empathy or sympathy, and whose manner and actions demonstrate that he has no grounding principles.
Its time for a wake up call, the country is in big trouble, Romney can't fix it and Obama can't start to fix it alone.  People need to go after Congress and vote the bums out who put politics ahead of doing whats right for the American people and yes that means Democrats as well as a bunch of lock step Republicans or move and sit near the back of the country because we are heading for one big crash.
So is Obama.
I say OBAMA is
This is the same thing the republicons were saying about John Kerry.  
It worked then, and Rmoney is even more out of touch with Americans.
