The pilots on one side of cockpit not knowing what the one on the other side was doing sounded a little familiar.

Isn't that pretty much what happened on Egypt Air 990 crash?
It was a Boeing jet.

The thesis of the last half of the article was basically, "if it was a Boeing then this would not happen."

So, how did it happen on the Egyptian flight?

Maybe there is a common factor to both flights, and it is not simply the controls being of one type or the other.
