from Morocco to Yemen, sexual harassment is endemic. 

in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere , child marriage is also practiced and women are perpetually minors regardless of their age or education.

How much do they hate women ? 

So much so that 15 girls died in a school fire in Mecca in 2002, after " morality police " barred them from fleeing the burning building -- and kept firefighters from rescuing them -- because the girls were not wearing headscarves and cloaks required in public. And nothing happened. No one was put on trial. Parents were silenced. 

This, however, is no mere Saudi phenomenon, no hateful curiosity in the oil  rich, isolated desert. The Islamist hatred of women burns brightly across the region -- now more than ever.

But these are the Left's heroes.
Where is the World Conference on Men? You show me any place in the world and i'll guarantee that men got it worse than women.
Huh?  Sez hoo?
Antarctica?
More importantly - who let them out of the kitchen?
uuuh yeah. Since 1955 there have been 55 fatalities in Antarctica. I think all male. But I did read that a female scientist was drowned by a seal a couple of months ago. http://www.radiocom.net/vx6/memorial.htm
What else you got?
The picture of the lady in front of the shack is terrible. Why should she have to sit in front of the shack when her husband is out partying with the posh people. Maybe they could come to an agreement. Let the shack lady go out and party while the man sits in front of the shack. Seems fair to me.
"what else you got?"

LOL! This is a contest? ;-)
See american ladies, its not so bad. Back in the kithen! /s
No of course not. You were jesting with your antarctica comment i'm just trying to prove a point.
