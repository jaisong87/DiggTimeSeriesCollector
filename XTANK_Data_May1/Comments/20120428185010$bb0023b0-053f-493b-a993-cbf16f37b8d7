Federal ban on moving companies???
I love the fuckwits who are here to defend the world's largest corporation cheating on taxes.

Cheat? What rules have they broken? What they are doing is 100% within the law.

when corporations like this have so much power due to their great wealth, laws are bent in their favor, leaving ordinary people to pick up the difference.
