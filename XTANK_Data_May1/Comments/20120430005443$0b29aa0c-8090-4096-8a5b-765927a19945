Hey Gore you fool! NO ONE IS LISTENING! Now go back to  your house that consumes 20 times the national average energy for an american home.
Its real just like AL Gore really invented the internet.
Two thoughts occurred to me as I read this article:

 - Firstly, "the vast majority of scientists" do NOT agree with your Creationist-level theory of AGW, Al.  Once they see actual facts and realize that most of the articles on the issue cite each other and/or tainted evidence streams as "proof" scientists back off on their support.  Your side just suppresses and ignores when former supporters bail from the boat, unless of course it's too high profile to ignore--then you try to ridicule them.  Pathetic.
 - Secondly, Al's looking more than a bit 'well fed" in that picture.  Doesn't he know the larger carbon footprint (no pun intended) that a plump person has on the environment?  Or is he one of the "elite" and hence "the rules don't apply" to him?
