Should be "Stretching AFTER a workout" 
Studies have shown that you should perform dynamic stretching prior to exercise. Static after.
that's not the only thing stretching
why is this on the front page?
Yes, I'll have one of those!
Well one girl at our local gym stretched so hard her boobies fell out.
I'd like to stretch her out... if you know what I'm saying.
Photo-shop
pics or it didn't happen.
I would much like to assist with this stretching.
Damn, hows this piece of shit hits fp, Buried
That is so on!
I have shorts just like that!
Agreed!
Um, this is Digg.  After Diggv4 was released, it became a playground for trolls wanting pics of hot chicks.
I don't, please explain.
He thinks she's made of taffy.
this was on the front page twice under 2 diff headers. wtf
new digg sucks in the lack of good content, and far fewer comments on each story, at least someone else gets it
That chick rollerblading.....HOT!
Ohhhh....I see.  I like taffy too  =)
Well the boobies fell on my cam and it broke the lens?
