Good! the hard workers earn more money!
What "hard workers"?  The "HARD WORKERS" are the people being screwed by the power elite in control- The Tory head of state of the UK puppet regime have blown the social safety net to pieces and allowing MILLIONs to fall through. Those millions ARE the HARD WORKERS - NOT the wealthiest, laziest and corrupt 1% who siphon the life from the blood, sweat and tears of the masses.
The British... They're just like us!
Or.....we are like them..
and the rich get richer
Or there could be "hard workers" among both the rich and the poor...
cosmicsurfer,

You are insane.
Government of the rich, by the rich, and for the rich.
Cause= Central Banking System
That has always been standard in the UK. It's the reason the American Colonies went independent.
I blame universal healthcare!
how many billionaires have EVAR done a hard day's work?  hard work has nothing to do with the amount you will earn.  unfortunately, your willingness to screw over your fellow man is directly proportional to the amount you will earn.
