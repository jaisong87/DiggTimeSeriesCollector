Someone call Will Smith
"Habitable worlds boost chance of finding life as WE know it - Space"

Alien life would be, by definition, DIFFERENT from anything we are familiar with.  We seem to be searching for life which is similar to life on our planet not alien life.
You are correct. But for all practical purposes, looking for life 'as we know it' is the logical starting point. It's even harder to find something if you don't even quite know what you are looking for!
Nope...alien life, by definition, is simply life that did not originate on Earth. There is no necessary correlate that it must be different in any other way from the life forms we are familiar with. In fact, under identical conditions it is most probable that identical life forms would evolve.
