I don't care about gear, just give me coffee!
nice post
There are only two things that make the morning even slightly bearable for those of us morning impaired.  That's copious amounts of caffeine, and a scalding hot shower to wake you up.  All of the crap in this article is just overpriced crap.
a mirror throwing all sorts of information into my face while im half awake is even more miserable.
when i used to smoke it was the first cigarette (or joint) w/the caffeine hit that got me going.
Since i gave up on smoking & caffeine i'm much more sluggish.
Ditto
I work at nite.
The best way to make the morning less miserable is to make a habit of going to bed earlier  Takes a couple of weeks, but it DOES work.
nice share
Modernman.com is an awful website. Everything that's ever posted is written and marketed in a way that would be more directed towards women.

"Getting out of bed in the morning when you're tired, sick, or all snuggy-wuggy under the covers" ??? How gay is that?

Nobody needs "gear" to motivate themselves to get up. 

Modernman.com is simply a giant product referral site that disguises itself as portal for "modern men". I guess if modern men are feminized versions of how men used to be then this site would be useful - but take a look at yourself if you are the one being lured in by this site. You're probably not so much of a modern "man".
