It is always fascinating to see America through the eyes of someone from elsewhere. I guess we all envision places and people that we have never visited and what they might really be like. This fellow had the opportunity and was able to overlay the visions with the reality that he found here and in the end took us off our cold pedestal in his mind into the reality that is now the memory of his visit. It was an interesting video.
