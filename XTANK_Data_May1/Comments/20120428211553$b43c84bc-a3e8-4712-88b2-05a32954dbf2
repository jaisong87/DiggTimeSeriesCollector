Where is Code Pink and Cindy ?

Where are the protests to close Gitmo ?
Where are you in all of this?
Code Pink and Cindy should be consistent.

They appear to only be shills... like most politicians of both parties.
Everyone should want Gitmo closed, so passing the blame is not taking responsibility IMO.
Many do and others do not want Gitmo closed [ and military trials held there, etc. ] . This debate has been and likely will  be going on forever.

My point is being a shill [ from both political sides ]. For example :

Republicans derided Barack Obama's claim that U.S. air attacks against Libya did not constitute hostilities and demanded that he seek congressional approval for the military operation [ the War Powers Act ].

House Speaker John Boehner threatened to withhold money for the mission, pitting a Congress  to exercise its power of the purse ...

Of course, John Boehner was all talk and continued the funding of that illegal war.

But, hey, we understand that "it's hard" (quoting your little godlet of war crimes, GW) to research anything outside the limited bookmarks of  RWNJ psychosis from Tea Party Nation, ResistNet, WND, NewsMax,  FREEPER Repub, Weasels,  and a few others.

There have been plenty of protests but not plenty of coverage. You just can't figure it out can you?

Just because you don't pay attention does not mean it doesn't exist.
Gitmo should not be closed but the system for validating threats and people's activities against the world should be better substantiated, and nobody should be held forever without a trial.
