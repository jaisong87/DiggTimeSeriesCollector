Wow, this surprises me a bit. 

Do you think these measures are too extreme or appropriate? I recently wrote an article on using RFID for large events such as the Olympics. If you don't know what RFID is, feel free to read the article below to get a better understanding of it.

After you read the article, let me know if you think that a lot of the security issues could be resolved if this method was implemented.

Why not just surgically implant it into people's foreheads?
LoL, I am sure that within a few months, someone would hack the cards and then there would be a major problem of getting it back out of people :P
Frankly if I were the terrorists I wouldn't even bother bombing anything, I'd just call in bomb threats or reports of possible suicide bombers describing any Middle Eastern looking people I saw on trains in an attempt to get the Police to kill someone innocent.  

At the very least the Police storming in like this will freak people the hell out and cause massive service disruptions and you have plenty of potential upside when they start screaming at some innocent foreign guy who maybe doesn't speak English and might very well react in a way that causes them to shoot someone totally innocent and cause a massive shit storm.
Typical of police now a days. Like why step on an ant to kill it if you can bring in a couple of steamrollers to do it.
