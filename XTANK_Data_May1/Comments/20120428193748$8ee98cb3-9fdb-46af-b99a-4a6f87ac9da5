This is a poem by Luis Valdez, which Curtis Acosta and Jose Gonzalez had their students recite every day before class. It was an integral part of the la raza curriculum, and now it has been banned by the Tuscon Unified School District.

The Other Me
In Lak'ech

Tu eres mi otro yo
You are my other me
Si te hago daño a ti
If I do harm to you
Me hago daño a mi
I do harm to myself
Si te amo y te respeto
If I love and respect you
Me amo y me respeto yo
I love and respect myself
