What are the southern Europeans supposed to do? Stay in their own countries with prospect for good paying jobs very low?
Your putting the cart before the horse. Why are the young forced to leave their own countries now after decades of "Socialist promises" from their political parties that have failed miserably?
I disagree with that assertion because it is only those nations that are poor, PIGS nations or having serious financial crisis that are experiencing exodus.
Of course you do.
