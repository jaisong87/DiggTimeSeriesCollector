I don't think that is Pinterest's biggest problem:

"Most Pinterest users sign-up to the site using their Facebook accounts, and AppData, which monitors how often users of third-party apps and Web sites interact with Facebook, says the number of Facebook-connected Pinterest users has declined precipitously the past 50 days.

Monthly active users are down from 11.3 million on March 1 to 11.15 million on April 1 to just 8.3 million today."

Pinterest has, without a question, developed a self-growing concept, which is smart, but yet questionable.
What have your experiences been with Pinterest? 
I have read many articles about internet marketers complaining that Pinterest had converted their affiliate links into their own to make money. 

Have you had any similar experiences?
This was my first comment ever, and I thought I was logged into my account, but instead Digg logged me in through Facebook. I guess we learn as we go along
