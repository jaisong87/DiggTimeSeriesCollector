The prophecy of the beast is coming closer to its fulfillment as the end of the 70 years of isaiah's prophecy is coming to a close
well an asteroid can brush past the earth and burn us all. Or perhaps drag away our atmosphere like what happened to mars. I think I will have these M & Ms now just in case.
populist far right parties are just giving a lot of empty promises and people want to believe and want to have a scapegoat in this economical climate 
much like in the 30's
and in hindsight they all blame somebody else sure it was all hitlers fault
not all the people who voted for him at all never ever ever...
in the u.s. common sense hasn't stopped the stupid from making things worse.
i become more convinced every day that the hope for humans isn't on earth.  i think the unfortunate reality is that earth will inherit the meek and they aren't very nice people.
Not just in Europe. This shit is becoming quite terrifying.
Could this be a sign that the political tactics of extremism are taking a hold around the globe ? I believe that it is , alongside the "awakening' that is also happening causing a cry around the globe for fairness in the structure of economies the "elite" forces that have exploited the freedoms inherent in a global free-market based money system, are feeling threatened by this widespread outcry for fairness and the awareness it brings !
Is this the same Le Pen whose mother walked out on her father and then posed for Playboy?  At least the mother is sane.
The Far Right is on the move because Socialism and Multiculturalism are seen as failures and cultural capitulation...especially in Western Europe
"populist far right parties are just giving a lot of empty promises and people want to believe and want to have a scapegoat in this economical climate"

Sounds familiar...

To Obama fairness means taking our money and giving it to his cronies.
Huh??

Your reasoning, "facts", their sources, your sense of civility and even use of use of the meme "OMG" reeks of spoiled adolescent girl logic, who likely borrowed her father's political stance. For all that typing, there's nothing even resembling a fully cohesive argument.
You are either 1. referring to a town in Somalia or 2. soliciting for oral sex.
3. both ?
if Multiculturalism is a failure then it's not just Multiculturalism which is a failure it's mankind as a whole
naw' it's multiculturalism.  When you have a culture that is as predatory as Islam is then it will cause multiculturalism FAIL.
You Christianity. They did basically all of the things Isalmics did and far worse. Your argument will be nothing more than "oh it happened HUNDREDS of years ago, so it's totally not relevant!"

But you forget that the methodology early Christians employed was: convert or die. Quite simply if the Islamic have adopted that ideology I see no reason any Christian can cry foul...it'd be hypocritical a best.

Christianity was one of the most predatory religions in our history, whether for good or for bad.
Right over your head, huh?
But you forget that the methodology early Christians employed was: convert or die"...

Certainly not the first century Christians of which I am a part.
"the methodology early Christians employed was: convert or die. "

Cite.
What is this some kind of lame-ass attempt at a Jedi mind trick?

crap... what if this shit works....  ummmm.... just in case:

Don't follow me.
...so... johnporosh - whose avatar is a female is soliciting sex with a peppermint pig and some rudegar in Somalia ?  

That sounds like a dirty Cohen Brothers movie.
?  Do you know the way ?
All of the crusades, the dark ages, the salem witch trials, the various Inquisitions, etc.

I won't bother to do all of your work for you, but here's a good point to start reading. Please check out the sources.

Christianity is ripe with the blood of "heretics", non-believers, and those of other faiths.
Review my reply to kasha34.
Uhhh... yeahhh .. Islam did that hundreds of years ago... time to update the playbook and get with the modern world already.
No... stop it.... stop saying it... I'm not falling for your David Koresh bullshit... just stop....
It's already here... I am Teh Beast ! 

I defy you to prove otherwise.

You will all neal before me... I am your ZOD!

you nailed it
The Crusades, the Inquisitions?  That wasn't "early Christians"!

Also, wasn't that like A LONG TIME AGO?  How long is that gonna serve as a balance for the atrocities Islam commits in the here and now?
Islam did that hundreds of years ago?
There are incidents now.
Hell, Egyptians killed Coptics and burned their churches just a couple months ago.  While their stinking Egyptian police stood by and watched.
"But you forget that the methodology early Christians employed was: convert or die. Quite simply if the Islamic have adopted that ideology I see no reason any Christian can cry foul...it'd be hypocritical a best."
ummm... exactly my point - which was in response was in response to mlw4428's ridiculous assertions.

P.S.  The attacks on Christian Churches by Muslims in Nigeria are ongoing as well.
I'm sure you've heard it before, but when the meek inherit the earth, they only inherit six vertical feet of it, unless they choose to be cremated, then made into fireworks.
oh great.  Now I'm going to have that song stuck in my head all night.
Funny thing is, Europe's far right are pretty darned liberal compared to the Republican or Tea Parties in the US.
The council of Nicea AD 325.  The reason it was called was because there was open warfare in the streets between Christians and Pagans.  The Pagan Emperor Constantine wanted to stop the fighting.  
  Before that is was the female Christian Priests who were exterminated.
don't mind them.  they are like the dogs that live in the field and bark at everyone that goes by.  its just doggy fun.
as long as i'm not around...  they can inherent all over each other.
Islam is doing that now.  Today.
Wait, what's wrong with Skittles?! :(
Nothing - as long as you're not wearing a hoodie while eatin them!
You think that's bad?  " Don't turn around..."
Why would he/she/it be soliciting oral sex... ?  Wait... are you wearing lipstick? Who put that on you?
I would need a lot of drugs to follow your thought process there...  I mean a serious shit-pile of drugs... like Charlie Sheen weekend blowout kinda drugs...
An on! Into irrelevance.
@Laura - Point of order, the most recent theories are that the Martian atmosphere got locked up  into chemical salts and/or bled away into space due to Mars'  lower gravity.
