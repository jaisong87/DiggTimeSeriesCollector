Oregon PERS on Digg, now I've seen everything!
So the facts show the number of people and their salaries are inconsequential, but the author uses the highest paying examples to make some sort of non-existent point.

Nice work.
Some interesting info.
If taken to its extreme (say everyone could retire and then was rehired) no one would be left paying in to the system.
In addition to limiting time per year, there should be a limit to the total amount of time you can come back to your old position. As long as someone is filling it, there is no incentive to either find an external candidate or develop someone from within.
I was just surprised by the size of the pensions alone. Some of these guys will be retired, but still in the top 10% of incomes nationally.
Public? In the private sector, senior jobs are outsourced to incompetents in India. Then Americans get the consulting work.  A lot of corporations do this as well. I guess it's only evil in the public sector. (according to right-wing idiots)
PERS is the Cadillac of retirement programs... Taxpayer funded of course...
Does anyone see how unsustainable pensions like these are? Never mind the incestuous nature of the double dipping. There is no one on earth, in the public sector, that should be making over $100K a year in retirement income. No one. Absolutely outrageous. Taxpayer money down the tubes. And don't tell me it's self funded because that's nonsense. All monies paid into the public employment system comes, at some point, from tax payer dollars. It doesn't just magically appear, unless of course, you count federal pensions which are paid for with printed money now since we have a $15 Trillion deficit. But I digress.
