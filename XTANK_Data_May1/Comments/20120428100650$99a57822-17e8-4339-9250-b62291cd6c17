Just got to LA about 2 weeks ago and I have yet to see the elusive LA skyline. 
Just got to LA about 2 weeks ago and I have yet to see the elusive LA skyline. 
It's a shame that it's so (relatively) small I can't pick out the Bonaventure Hotel in any of these shots.  It has always been one of my favorite LA buildings.
Remember: Los Angeles County is a Bigger area than New Jersey!! The metro area sprawls over major parts of 5 COUNTIES! One of which, (San Bernardino) is the largest single count in land area in the entire country. 

The earthquake-prone geology also makes it harder to find bedrock that can support the kind of height you see in NYC or Chicago. The city itself is a bigger area than either of them, and Chicago is by no means compact.

 The valley itself is essentially flat-bottomed, which also lend itself to keeping buildings low, and building the entire valley full. 

You REALLY CAN drive 500 miles in a day, and never even leave LA!

In a city like that, There is little incentive to "go high or go home"
That property is in a prime location! Twenty minutes to the beach, twenty minutes to downtown!
There's nothing to do downtown.
