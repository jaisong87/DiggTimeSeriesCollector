A very thought-provoking article.  One has to admire the courage of "Riodice" but what really struck me about the article are the many factors that contribute to freedom of speech and how they contribute to the erosion of freedom of speech.  The editorial staff are continually asking serious questions about what to cover and what not to cover, as well as what to publish and what not to publish, and end by saying "It's a question of finding the line."  I suppose every country, perhaps paper, has its line and it would be interesting to think systematically about how that line gets determiined.
