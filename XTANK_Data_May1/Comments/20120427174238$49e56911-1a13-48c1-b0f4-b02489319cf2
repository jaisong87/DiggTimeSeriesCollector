Starve the Beast indeed. One has nothing to do with another except that they want them both dead. This should be illegal or at least punishable in some political way. Poison pills are equally poison to both the victim and the poisoner, if the poisoner can be made to swallow half of it. Or more. Perhaps by switching the glasses when the poisoner is not looking, the victim can avoid any exposure at all. The beast is starving already. Ideology and Machiavellianism.
