Matthew 5: 43-48
The question is how does one truly love their neighbour?  To affirm them in their sin is not love.

Thus the Church broke it down into both corporal and spiritual works of mercy:

Corporal:

To feed the hungry;
To give drink to the thirsty;
To clothe the naked;
To harbour the harbourless;
To visit the sick;
To ransom the captive;
To bury the dead.


Spiritual:

To instruct the ignorant;
To counsel the doubtful;
To admonish sinners;
To bear wrongs patiently;
To forgive offences willingly;
To comfort the afflicted;
To pray for the living and the dead.
The libs are quoting the bible now huh?
Doubt most of the right has actually read it.  No take that back they love the old testement.
Quoting and taking out of context. Just like fundamentalists and most Protestants.
I read it, almost twice... That's why I'm not a christian...
apparently some morons on digg including yourself don't get out often enough.
they are selective like those they complain about
