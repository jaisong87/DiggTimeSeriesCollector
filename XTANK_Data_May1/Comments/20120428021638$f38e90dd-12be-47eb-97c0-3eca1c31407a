I am an atheist, and I hate Ayn Rand! Give me Socrates, Albert Einstein, The Dalai Lama, Martin Luther King Jr., or anyone who has a humanist, pantheist, or socialist worldview. I hate Ayn Rand's philosophy! It is all about the individual, selfish ambition, capitalism, & "survival of the fittest." I have a libertarian friend on Facebook who is constantly quoting & praising her, and we disagree completely with politics because I am a democratic socialist. I believe people are interdependent NOT independent. I believe that we NEED government. I believe in people helping each other to succeed in life, not the "you're on your own" philosophy of so many Republicans, libertarians, Tea Partiers, Ayn Randians, and free market capitalists. I strongly support all the Nordic countries (Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, & Denmark) who are democratic socialist countries that have universal health care, free college education, and many social support systems. I believe that "Together we stand, divided we fall." We're all in this together. We're all human beings, and we all matter.
There seems to be a lot of 180's by the Republicans this week. That will be a running theme right up until the election. It won't effect Romney to much though as he supports both sides of the issue.
Actions speak louder than words.  Look at his budget and you will see that it is full of social Darwinism for the 99%ers and government welfare for the 1%ers.  
He is a Randian extremist for everyone except his corporate masters.
