interesting
A pity it didn't include some of the beautiful women who used to be on TechTV.
number one was a flop....
You sir are wrong!
I can agree with the top 5.  Morgan Webb is hot as hell in my book.  Olivia Munn is smoking hot too.  Would have thought Sara Underwood woudl have been #1 though.  Munn and Underwood would both be #1 for me.  Mmmmmm
Sarah Lane was on Tech TV. She hosted the screen savers. The show that became attack of the show, when the networks merged.
It's nice to see Sarah Lane and Tina Wood mentioned. 2 of the best hosts the network ever had.  Back when G4 was actually a gaming network, and not the steaming pile of crap it is now.
Morgan Webb was also originally on Tech TV hosting X-play.
funny how they're all from attack of the show
People tend to no like being proven wrong.
Not all of them.
most lol
Yup. But that's ok. Them not liking it just makes me laugh even more. :)

"Gaming network"? I thought it was the 22-hour cops/cheaters network.
Yes please!
I miss the screen savers . Morgan webb should have been number one . Enough of that attack of the show crap though .
Morgan is fucking ugly. My ex-fiancee looks a lot like that Sara Jean Underwood chick. The first time I saw her on TV I did a triple take.
Morgan Webb? ::Pukes::
FAILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
She was actually the windows expert on The Screen Savers before going to X-play.
Some of these women look really awkward and trying too hard to be something they are not.
Top 15 sexiest host on Attack of the Show ... is that all that airs on G4? I might know if I subscribed.
oh nice. I didn't know that.
I like that the closer you get to #1 the less clothes they are wearing.
