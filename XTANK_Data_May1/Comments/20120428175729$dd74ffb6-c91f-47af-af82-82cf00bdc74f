Seriously? Has anyone conducting this study ever realized that blood is red? HURR DURR DERP DERP
Blood red is the key..
Because when I see red, I'm ready to tear everything up in my vision?
Nothing in the natural world is blue...even blueberries are purple. 
We would need to name the colors of things we see every day in our natural world before we start getting creative. 

Many languages/cultures have different names for blue and they learn those names from childhood.  They think and speak with different options because of their broader language.
"Nothing in the natural world is blue" hmm, the sky can be pretty damn blue.
Red was probably the first color our primitive ancestors saw. It is the ONLY basic color for which there are TWO completely different genetic sequences that actually produce normal perception, and also the most common type of color blindness. 

 In fact, since the genetic sequence is part of the X chromosome and is not present at all on the Y chromosome, there are a very few women in the world, and no men, who inherited one copy of each of the perfectly good red sequences. Where most people can, with a little effort and good lighting differentiate 32 shades of red, those few women can differentiate 144 shades of red, and the same number of shades of blue and green as the rest of us. 

The fact that it rides on the X chromosome is the reason nearly all color-blind people are male. 

Blue may well have been the LAST to evolve.
The sky and some water being blue goes without saying...my bad on that for sure.  As for blue frogs, blue flowers, and blue minerals, the average tribe could go their whole lives without ever seeing those.   The sky...well, they would probably want to name THAT color fairly quickly.
My guess is because red makes people think blood, danger, anger.. blue is a calming color.. don't need to give it as much attention
