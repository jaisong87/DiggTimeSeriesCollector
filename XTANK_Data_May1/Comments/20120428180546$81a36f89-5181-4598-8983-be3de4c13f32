An actual technology post... Will miracles never cease...

I didn't watch the video (lots of things to do today). I'm curious about the capability of the device. The last one I read about was a 256x256 with eight bit colour. Enough to read but not much more than that.
small article yet increasing curiosity .....waiting for next year....
Is there a possibility that the patient/client will be blind if anythings go wrong?
Thanks for sharing
well this  is incredible news
So the movies becoming a reality awesome
Previous versions connected electrodes to the visual cortex of the brain. I suppose it is possible for an accident to damage that part of the brain. They would make sure the current is low enough in the design so the initial implant /shouldn't/ cause problems. Problems may surface when in the area of a powerful transmitter of some source. Some of the American "pain generators" developed for the military or unshielded microwave ovens would likely be problems.

If it were possible to move away from an electrical based approach then the devices should be at least as robust as natural vision.
thanks man! they should be more careful....
I have an astigmatism, so you know I'm interested in this.
I agree. However if the development of the device is to continue and improve to the point where it IS completely safe they still need to follow through with human trials. It is very difficult to get any sort of meaningful feedback from a macaque. On the upside... After years of experimentation, researchers know the upper and lower limits of current the brain can handle.
