There are already people on the "news" saying that the delegate system is broken because Ron Paul and his "backers" or "followers" are playing by the rules.  Notice his supporters are always painted in a cultist light.  Sensationalism and labeling at it's best.

Remember when Paul was in the lead poll heading into the Iowa months ago?It was then people were asking "Should Iowa matter?" for a solid week.  Then Santorum won.  The same networks were trumpeting how important and amazing that he "won."  If that's not a double standard, I don't know what is.

The public truly is ignorant if they can't see what's going on.  Romney was anointed before the first straw poll.  For the people, by the people....yeah right.  Just tell all the dummies who to vote for, it's been working for quite a while now.

If you like the direction the country is going in right now, vote for Romney.  Then you can enjoy 4 more years of dwindling freedoms.  Paul's the only one that has a chance to beat him.  I'm not wrong.
