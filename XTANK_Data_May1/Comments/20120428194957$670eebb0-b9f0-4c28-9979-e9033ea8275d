Obama has restored all dignity to the office of the President, after the moral, and ethical failures of the last 5 Presidents combined. Especially Nixon, Ford, Reagan, W. Bush. FTFY.
You are an absolute moron.  The buffoon in the White House has been an embarrassment from day one.
Dang well said, skewsieQ lives in his own little world where he is a millionaire and has bad BO.
I can understand your embarrassment. It would have taken me two days to come up with some kind of a reply to after realizing the failure of a political party you belong to. But don't worry, one day when you're all grown up you will be able to deal with your failures a little easier.
