I think Apple could have benefited from a little more choice. Some users want a keyboard.
That would have never made it to market, the adults would have killed it. 
That would've been very surprising considering Apple's hate of buttons. I don't think the author of this article are even aware of what used to be called "Apple's war on buttons".
Pretty crappy article.
