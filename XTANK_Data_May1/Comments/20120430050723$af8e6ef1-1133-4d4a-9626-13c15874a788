Living without food for 4 days is doable but I didn't see a mention as to whether she had water or not.
If you are going to hike alone, be very careful.
4 days w/o food isn't a big deal.  You can go longer than that w/o food.  It's the lack of water that will kill you LONG before starvation can do you in.
You can survive a month without food.  If it was without water, then she got lucky.
I'd be willing to bet that her survival was due to 100% medical background and 0% faith and the invisible guy in the sky.
Can we please go at least one topic without bringing God into it if it has nothing to do with the subject?
I need to get my eyes checked. At first I thought it said "Hitler". That's taking Godwin to the extreme
For a sec I thought it said Hitler.
And there are bigger issues at hand than him surviving just those 4 days
That's like asking for an article about kittens not to have comments about how the lefties or the republicans.
FTA:

"I prayed a lot and derived comfort from it," the Mormon church member told reporters on Sunday. "I thought God would do everything possible to help me overcome my stupidity. I learned from my mother that things can always be worse."
So you think that a positive attitude derived from her faith (it doesn't matter if God actually led to her surviving or not or whether He exists or not) didn't help? She (in her quote you so blessedly provided) even said it helped her.So why be so bitter about it?
