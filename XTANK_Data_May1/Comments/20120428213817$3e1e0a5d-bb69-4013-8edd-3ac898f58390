"I propose we do away with the "h" word and replace it with something else, something that does not dignify the crime, even if it's unintentional, via the use of the word "honour." Let's instead call them "OWNERSHIP CRIMES," that is, crimes that are perpetrated specifically because a young woman has had the audacity to demand a say in her own future, and to claim ownership of her own person, including her own body, including her own vagina. That in direct defiance of the men in her immediate family who, for reasons of culture and/or religion, insist ownership of a woman's body and destiny is theirs alone."
I agree. Let's not give it the dignity of the word honor.
FINALLY someone has correctly defined this horrific crime.
