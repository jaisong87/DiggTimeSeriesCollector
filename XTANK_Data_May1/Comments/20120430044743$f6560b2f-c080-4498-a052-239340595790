Some dayz I get the sinking feeling that Orwell was n optimist.

I think new Mexico is playing with fire shutting off people's utilities. To many bad things can happen to families over a speeding ticket they clearly cannot pay. If they can't pay a fine, how the heck can they manage without the utilities they rely on which will continue to possibly be a financial hardship for them?
TIME IS GETTING WORSE EVERYWHERE :o
Glad I'm not the poor shmuck who is going to have to stand in front of the US Supreme Court and defend THIS one.
with the chaos that will ensue over turning off peoples water, new mexico might start looking like the old one.

clearly the city is in the wrong here. if they structured their laws in a way that they can't take people to court for not paying the ticket, that should be end of story. they can't start shutting off people's utilities over this. utilities should only be turned off if the actual utility bills go unpaid.
Today?
The beast must have his money.
Will they now?  So run a red light , then a family of five can't eat, flush or do anything hygienic, nice way to stick it to them assholes!  What new from a 1%'ers country!
Let's see: I can see where some old lady, get her utilities cut.... family sues.... then 600K, doesn't seem like that much.
