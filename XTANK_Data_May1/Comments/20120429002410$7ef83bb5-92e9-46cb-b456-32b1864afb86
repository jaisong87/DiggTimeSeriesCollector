That's ok, she has a positive message that resonates well with voters, and especially women. The Republicans will only hurt themselve's with a barrage of negative ads. Especially with a male challenger. Those negative ads tend to backfire the closer you get to the election. She needs to stay positive, and not let them make her reactionary to those ads, which is typical Republican strategy. Their message isn't very effective if you don't respond to them.
This is politics as usual.  The Left (Liberals) has been doing this for a long time to the right (Conservatives).  Why is this news?

Read the article. Huge outside interests are sending millions of dollars to spread lies about the economy. Maybe one day you'll take that veil off your head.
The majority of the money to fund Jay Inslee for governor in WA is from New York, and WI is loaded with buses full of protesters and big union money from out of state to spread lies and misinformation.  How exactly do you see a difference here?
Wishful thinking
crickets
When you have the money you control the message.  Why do you think 70% of all political talk shows discuss only what Republican's want them to discuss.  It's not a debate when one side gets to set the agenda for what is to be debated.  People without money are a whisper in the wind.
So you think dems are so stupid that watching ads on TV will make them vote republican?
Even more reason to encourage Super Pacs IMHO.  They allow groups of less wealthy individuals to now compete with big business and unions on an equal footing don't you think?
Not so much dems but the public in general.  Look at how many idiots voted for "hope & change" before flipping on Jersey Shore.
When Hillary Clinton did much the same thing when she ran for the US Senate, in New York, and had to buy a house a few days before entering the race, the NY Times didn' t have an issue with it, I wonder why? Maybe they are biased? Nah ...lol
