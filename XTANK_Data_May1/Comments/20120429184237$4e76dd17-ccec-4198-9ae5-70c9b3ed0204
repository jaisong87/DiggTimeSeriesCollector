The only thing new is the RW extremists screaming "freedom and liberty" while castigating and screeching nasty epithets at those who actually are keeping us free while supporting the actual destruction of the free exchange of ideas and free speech by promoting the abuse by the police, the CIA, the Fed, the politico shills for their corporate owners and those corporate pigs.
