I want to see this, I've often wondered what my cats see and do when they're out.
It's been done before - but it's neat to see what they're up to.
The documentary is currently showing at the Tribeca Film Festival. You can see the film, "Catcam," by registering for a free account at the Tribeca online film site (but voting is over), the film will be up until 4/30/12:

Keep in mind, while no animal sees in complete darkness, cats DO see much better in very low light than that camera ever will. 
Also, while cats don't hear quite as well as dogs, they still hear much better than humans. While they can't smell as well as dogs, again their sense of smell BLOWS AWAY anything humans can experience. We STILL don't really know what it's like.
