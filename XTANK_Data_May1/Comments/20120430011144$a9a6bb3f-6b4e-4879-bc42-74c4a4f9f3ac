Mastered for iTunes?  To me this is non-sense since iTunes has the Apple lossless encoder.  Why not master it normally and bring in lossless files?  If you are going THAT far and can really tell the difference in passing AND care enough about that difference, then you should have moved to FLAC or something by now.
"British recording engineer Ian Shepard called the entire process of specially mastering audio files for iTunes to sound more like the CD version simple "BS."
And he is right.

Compressed music is compressed music, it's not gonna sound as good as the original, period.  Granted 95% of people listen to music on shitty headphones or a crappy bookshelf system, so they won't care.  Unfortunately, for the other people with decent equipment it's just not the same as listening to the version that the artist intended to put out.
Of course it's nonsense. A compressed sound file at bit rate "X" that is engineered properly isn't going to sound any better than another engineered properly. AAC "mostly" sounds better than their MP3 counterparts (not that I could tell after lots of 70s era rock concerts), so maybe that's what they mean. Doesn't make it anything more than marketing hype though
It would be nice if some of the artists would pay attention to the quality of their music files.

Some are oversampled, and exceed the maximum volume, others (especially Disney sponsored artists) have muddy tracks that are barely listenable.
