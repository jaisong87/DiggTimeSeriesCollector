Disclosure is a good idea, ending unlimited donations totally is better.
Openness. What a concept.
you libs prob dont want to wish for this. The axe swings both ways, when the world can find out all the shit Soros is funding the libs are going to have lots of egg on their faces
sure, there are skeletons in the closet for both sides... but honestly i dont see liberals are going to come out of this as the worst ones.
Just as I thought. The Chamber of Commerce giving foreign countries the right to have theirs here are back-stabbing ENEMIES!
ROFL!  Obama did not have a non disclosing political group until this year.  Last I heard his new super pac isn't doing that well either.
FTA:
"Today is a good day for disclosure, and we will continue our fight to restore the integrity of our electoral process," Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), the lead plaintiff in the case, said in a statement. "The American people have a right to know who is behind the front groups spending millions of dollars to sway their vote."

Why is it the Democrats who want open elections and the republicons who want secrecy?
As long as the axe swings both ways, I can live with that.
Thing is, Rove and the Kochs are rote amateurs, with neither the depth of international political experience, nor the cabal of already-on-the-take politicians, to even come close to Soros. If and when we ever see 'disclosure', the deep reach and influence of Soros will make Koch money look pitiful and unimportant. 
I suspect, however, that any 'disclosure' laws can apply only to American expenditures through American financial institutions. Thus, Soros can utilize his breadth of international businesses and intermediaries to hide most of his American political purchases. I doesn't count, or even exist, if  happens outside the country.
And, once again, I congratulate President Obama on his second term, purchased over two years ago, by Soros and related comrades.
