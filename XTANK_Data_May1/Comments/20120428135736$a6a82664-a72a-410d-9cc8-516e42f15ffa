If this turns out to be for real our technological advancements are beginning to be beyond comprehension! Wish I could say the same about the rate at which we evolve! No matter how great the invention we want to slap a capitalistic value on it!
A /second/ actual technology article posted to the technology section. I am getting impressed... ;-)

This is a fascinating update. Again, I didn't watch the video because I'll have a lot to do today. It'll be interesting to see the results when the researchers attempt to do something serious with these machines. In spite of what they say in the article, 300 atoms isn't very many. None the less, it is a big step compared to where researchers were at even six months ago.

Just a random thought... It would be a waste of a perfectly good quantum computer if someone ported Windows over to it. ;-)
