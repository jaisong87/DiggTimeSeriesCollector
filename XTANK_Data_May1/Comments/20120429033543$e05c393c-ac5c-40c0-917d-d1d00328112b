If ROMNEY would just go to a factory BAIN CLOSED, he could get it correct!  Do you think he will do that?
No - That mean's he would have to walk in the filth he creates and acknowledge he is nothing but a vehicle for raw effluent....
But every time he closed a business, BAIN MADE MONEY, that is his entire point.  JOBS ARE OF NO VALUE.
