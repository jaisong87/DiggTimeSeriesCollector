Bill Clinton knows a lot about taking down things. And going down on Monica Lewinsky. 

He took down his own presidency and was impeached.
Watch out now the BIG GUNS ...armed WITH TRUTH and not simple minded partisan spin and  girlish name -calling are "on deck' ......and it is going to be along,long day for the extremist right !
Let go!  You really like to fantasize about it, don't you?  He didn't break the multitude of laws that Reagan did.  He did break near as many as Bush did.  

President Clinton can and does travel to other countries.  They request him and pay him huge sums to come and talk.  And when Obama is done he will do the same.

Bush, Cheney, and Rumsfeld can't leave the US or they will be charged and tried.  How about that shit?

Aren't you proud of your former representation?
