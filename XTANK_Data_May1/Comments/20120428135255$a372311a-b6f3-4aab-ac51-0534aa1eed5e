I think the key to preventing this crap from happening is definitely to hold prosecutors and accountable.  Disbarment and even jail time for the prosecutor should be ready options in cases where evidence is ignored or embellished to fill holes.  We already put way, way too many people behind bars each year.  It's time to make convictions require much more solid evidence - not including witnesses who are often coerced to polish their testimony.  That would include grand juries to determine the validity of ANY questionable murder charge, and heavy penalties for dirty prosecutors.  It's a bigger problem than people realize.
I suspect there was something fishy going on between morton and the sheriff back in the day.
I am amazed they did not go after the cops who clearly did not do their jobs.  What a horrible thing to have happened and then to compound it by the people in law enforcement not doing the job they upheld to do!  Amazing
