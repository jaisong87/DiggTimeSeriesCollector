Yup... First liar ain't got a chance...
Wars are not healthy for soldiers or civilians...never have been and in all probability never will be. "Collateral damage" is virtually an inherent consequence to the exercise of violence. Whether and how much of it is justified by the objectives is something for the higher pay grades to assess...but denying that it occurs is simply asinine.
"We need to kill you to keep you safe!"
