'The president continued: "I can't nullify congressional law. I can't ask the Justice Department to say, 'Ignore completely a federal law that's on the books.' What I can say is, 'Use your prosecutorial discretion and properly prioritize your resources to go after things that are really doing folks damage.' As a consequence, there haven't been prosecutions of users of marijuana for medical purposes."'

As someone who feels I have nowhere else to go politically except vote for his re-election, this policy is not the only disappointment of this presidency.  There are many other Federal criminal statutes which could be prosecuted as vigorously; financial fraud, money laundering, insider trading and tax evasion to name but a few.  Everyone agrees resources are stretched and there is a pressing need to prioritise.  Why can't the resources directed at prosecution of producers of medical marijuana be diverted to some of these offences?
