Metrosexuality is part of Obama's cool factor.
How about his affair with Larry Sinclair? Is that also cool?
He's cool alright, think it has a lot to do with a good family, good education and cultural experiences. Talking and listening  to thousands of people over his lifetime, didn't hurt either.   Hey do you see strange text up there or is it my computer with another malware?
Alex Jones gave us a heads up that Obama may come out.
Good family?!  LOL.  You mean his old white racist grandma?  His dad who had more than one wife?  His old white lazy Grandad living off his wife? Eating dog and being proud of it?
