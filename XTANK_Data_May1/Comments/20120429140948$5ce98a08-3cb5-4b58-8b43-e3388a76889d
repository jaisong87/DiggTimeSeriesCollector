Many states that lack a centralized clean energy authority have created revolving loan programs for investment in energy efficiency. Overall, more than 20 states combine to raise about $500 million each year for such projects, according to a report released by clean energy researchers in January. The money has helped finance more than 72,000 projects that generate renewable energy or increase efficiency.
