"you may say I'm a dreamer but I'm not the only one"  JL.  nice speech indeed. The planet will heal but in the meantime we the people, as if we mattered, will suffer. It looks like we don't deserve the stars, I've started hoping for the meteor. This is what happens when all that matters to us is the bottom line, when wealth means more than lives. The US has been the leader in this, nice work fucking everyone.
