I can't believe it was 20 years ago...
I was 11 but my dad had all three TVs in the living room watching it like a hawk.
"Power to the people?" The idiots destroyed their own neighborhoods. Nobody cared. Nobody cares if they do it again.
Since when is the wanton destruction of private property, looting and the victimization of random / innocents considered "Power to the People".

The Black community did nothing but reenforce their negative image

Power to the People,get real they just wanted to fuk up sh1t.the riots confirmed one thing.uneducated right of entitlement bull sh1t.fuk them for the destruction of private property.cops should have used a 50 cal.
Don't slander "power to the people" with such a dumbass statement.
Please return to your cave and don't come out til we call.
I remember Reginald Denny getting yank out of his truck, and those Asians that defended their 7-eleven with shotguns and rifles.
There will be more riots when the Zimmerman verdict comes in..either way...either to celebrate or to blame whitey
Yeah...it's a line from an Icecube song.
Zimmerman is hispanic....
Doesn't matter. The media machine is ramping up the racial tensions where none exist. How strange that the timing just happens to coincide with an election year.
@ka5p3r
I stopped at "fuk up sh1t". There is a reason why modern day American college 101 books are now written at a 5th grade reading level. America has become a nation of sensationalized, stupid, fat, self-entitled pigs.
Doesn't seem like that long.
