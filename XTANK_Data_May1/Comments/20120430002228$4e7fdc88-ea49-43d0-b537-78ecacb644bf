I wonder sometimes if we'll even survive to the next election at the rate Obama is tyrannically destroying America. He seems to be trying his level best to put a stake through America's heart and bring her down. If he's re-elected and will no longer have to worry about another election, heaven help us because he will use "executive orders" to finish his task of shredding whatever is left of our constitution.
Did they forget to put a parody disclaimer at the end of the article?
