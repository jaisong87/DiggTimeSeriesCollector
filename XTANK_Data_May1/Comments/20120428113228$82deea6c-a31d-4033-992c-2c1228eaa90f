Nicely done! Was this taken from inside? How did you get the camera to always be in the same place? Or was it done digitally?
This has been around a while. Most people have already seen it.
Watching this video clip... I actually realize that changes in season do influence the manner in which we perceive the environment around us. In real life is often very subtle, but speed-up, as in the video clip, one can see the impact of change much more dramatically.
