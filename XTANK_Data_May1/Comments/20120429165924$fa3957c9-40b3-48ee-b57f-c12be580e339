I hope the son of the deposed ruler wasn't one of them! I've been waiting for his $1 million for months!  after I sent him my $250, my checking account info and SSN for the money transfer, should be any day now!
No way. He said that was my money!

The Great Story Of The Day
Only seems right. Just think from the beginning of the church during the crusades dark ages and so forth how many people did the christian/catholic church kill. You had crusaders rapeing killing and pillaging their way to and from Jerusalum. When they got there their main target was the muslims. All of that because the pope told them all their sins would be absolved if they took the crusade. Isn't that ironic
well you guys are shit out of luck I have counted this stuff 5 times today Im fixing to roll a joint out of a $100 bill and count it again.
Funny how you need to compare Islamic radicalism today to Christianity hundreds of years ago. How can you justify suicide bombings against people who had nothing to do with the crusades?
Buried for thinking that the Roman Catholic church is, and speaks for, all Christians everywhere throughout all time.

Your lack of education and willful ignorance is showing.
And Nigeria is what? something less than 20% Muslim??
