Our own Cory Richards, high-altitude climber and National Geographic photographer, was the victim yesterday. While the South Col team did an acclimatization run up to Camp 3 at 23,000 feet, Conrad and Cory reconned in the opposite direction, up toward the West Shoulder. They reached a high point of 23,000 feet before determining that this line was too dangerous due to rock fall. They turned around at 11:15, at which point Cory began to feel chest pain and a severe shortness of breath. http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/everest/blog
