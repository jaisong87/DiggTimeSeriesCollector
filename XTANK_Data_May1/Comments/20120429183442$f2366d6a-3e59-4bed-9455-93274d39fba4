Dear Hollywood: Thank you for helping out piracy by releasing this a week early in other countries, so that Americans could download it for free. 

What a bunch of morons. And they wonder why they can't stop piracy.
i am waiting to see it in the theatre.  i dont really think a shitty cam will make any impact to a movie like this.
Yeah. I would still see it in the theater as well. and I'm sure alot of people that are downloading it will still go to the theater. This is one of those movies that needs to be seen on a big screen.  But there will be the ones that  won't care, and just won't bother going after seeing the cam.
Yep, theater is the way to go. I just don't understand the downloading of a movie like this to watch on your laptop. Screw that. Shell out the $10 and skip a couple of Starbuck's mocha frappuccinos.

welcome to being the rest of the world for a change.
First of all, you don't need to quote my entire post. I know what you are responding to, and why. I really don't get why people need to quote every single thing.

Second; Fuck the rest of the world. This is an American movie. It should be released here first.
"Fuck the rest of the world."

no, fuck you. you complain about piracy because its released somewhere else first, then you complain about piracy in the rest of the world because they dont pay for your American movie.

stop the fucking BS and release it everywhere at once.
When exactly was I complaining about piracy? I love piracy. :)
