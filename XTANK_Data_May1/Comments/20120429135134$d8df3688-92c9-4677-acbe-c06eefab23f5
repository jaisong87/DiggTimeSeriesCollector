I forgive myself that I have accepted and allowed myself to refuse to see that this parental training of the children through generations is in fact the reason why the world is in trouble. It all starts at home, as all systems, all abuse, all fear, all suffering, all dishonesty and every facet of the disregard of life starts at home with parents the direct cause of what happens in the world in every way.
Another MUST READ for those who have the courage to take the red pill and dare to see the reality of ourselves and our responsibility for what we are creating not only for us, but for all LIFE as what we have accepted and allowed through ignorance and ego.
Very inspiring and worth reading post. the content is great and it helps us readers to improve, reflect and understand more of ourselves.
