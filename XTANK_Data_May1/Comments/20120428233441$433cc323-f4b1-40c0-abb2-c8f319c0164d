What a great concept the social media, a fantastic way to keep track of citizens budget agree?
the average facebook user has 229 friends? let's see in between 90's video games, drawing, reading writing, exercise, chess, chess study, multi media marketing books --I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR FACE BOOK AQUAINTANCES! geniuses use their time being productive. when i have money i'll go places. the weakest person is the one who fears dieing alone lol. not me baby!
I proudly assert my citizenship and love for the land of my birth and my participation in it's unique form of civic activism..involvement in the art of debate , and the exercise of free speech...social media has only afforded Americans such as myself (who looks for that "soap-box" every-time another politician makes a joke out of the word truth !
