Sorry, i dont understand what is the need of putting surface to air missiles to the rooftops, unnesesary expenditure.
Well here is the scoop, and Im not saying I believe any of it, Im just passing this along. The chatter is that there will be a ufo attack, but the ufo wont be alien, they will be us, but the public will be made to think they are alien. Then under that guise of world unity, and protection, the one world govt should be set into place. Even if this is wrong, the stakes are too high not to at least be aware of this. Now take in mind I am just repeating one thing that I have read. Its just information, do with it what you will.
fear mongering at it's best.
I like the InterContinental range ballistic missiles that are propelled using cryogenic engines. If you use one of them from a nearby place their explosive force is enhanced and the olympic stadium can be blown apart quite easily.
