great information
hopefully this bill goes as far as it should, but no further. it is clearly unacceptable to be asking for a facebook password, or to see pictures and communications which are locked down under privacy settings.

that being said, i am sympathetic if the potential employer goes to a potential employee's page and looks at things that available under the "publicly viewable" setting and uses that info in their decision making. 

using publicly available information from facebook should be perfectly legal, however coercing people to share their privacy restricted information shouldn't be. hopefully the text in the final bill will make a clear distinction between these two scenarios.
I  thought this was solved weeks ago!  Slow politicians like usual, but when they want to pass laws in the midnight hour without any American knowing , they sure will do that shit quick!
"Thank goodness there is some bill that can preserve law and order on computers, instead of just ones that make a mockery of it."

There's your problem: Thinking the solution is a law.
Most Americans find the idea (of employers asking for passwords) repulsive, and wouldn't work for an organization that demands this information. No law is needed.
