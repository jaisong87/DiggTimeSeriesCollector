Android os is amazing..i like the version after gingerbread.!! and now its on Tabs cool!!
Windows cant catch andro now..its way to advance!!
..In the US which is the only place its been launched. You would think a British tech writer would know this.
It just goes to show you how successful a good value tablet can be. You have to wonder what companies were up to before.
No article mentions the best thing about this is Amazon have created a new application store. Android while maintains binary compatibility, Apple really being the fragmenting itself from the group. This is wonderful for the consumer. If only other phone platforms has this advantage.
Kindle Fire looks like an interesting option. I might consider giving it a try.
this is exactly why android 'beats' apple sales in specific categories.  They are in a grey area that apple products can't be defined in the exact category.  Not to mention there are no family plans for the iPhone like T-mobile's. If Apple had a book specific tablet, and 12 companies making their phones, android would be a much more fitting distant second.  Not to mention a complete lack of entry level price points.
