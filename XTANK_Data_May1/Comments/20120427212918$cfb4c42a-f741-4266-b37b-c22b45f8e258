Because we have effectively stomped a mudhole in rightwing medias ass, to the point they aren't even half of what they used to be, and no longer have the influence over the narrative they once did.

$5 says Obama rubber stamps it into law.

DEFLECT! DEFLECT! DEFLECT!
So small they'll fit in a woman's vagina (ie vaginal probes).
The Tea Party has been hijacked by mainstream Republicans since Ron Paul departed it.  The Tea Party no longer has any meaning outside of the word republican.  DONT FALL VICTIM TO MORE GOP LIES.  Vote Libertarian, RON PAUL 2012.
Because a small government's main task is to stop thieves.
