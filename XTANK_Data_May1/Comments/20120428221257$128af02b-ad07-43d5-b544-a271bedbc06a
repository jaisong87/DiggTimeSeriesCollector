TSA is security theater
OMG - Baby on board
Sneaky terrorists - using cute babies as human bombs to bring terror into our lives.

TSA should just crush the skull of every infant carried into an airport from now on.

Did you know TSA are forbidden from searching muslim women?  Yup.  No touchy, no feely - it's against their religion.  Anal probes for WASP babies - terrorist wives and mistresses get a free pass.

I feel better - no way some camel riding freak is gonna notice we don't frisk his Mom, and wrap some C4 around her.  No way.

He'll stuff it up the ass of some 6 year old with CP from San Diego - and by god, the TSA will find it, or kill everyone that objects.
Another reason why babies and children shouldn't be allowed on planes!

It avoids the need for them to be molested by the TSA
Do us all a favor, and go fuck yourself.
classy.
TSA,stupidity so bad, it hurts !
TSA: "That baby might look innocent -- but his diaper's are loaded."
John Stossel had a segment on the private security force in San Francisco. They dynamically adjust to demand and do a great job. Even the TSA admits they catch more stuff than they do.

What is the TSA's response to opening up to more private security?

"is not in the interest of the federal government"

So, there you have it. There is a US vs THEM mentality. It is our US vs Our Government.

Many will argue that the TSA denies this. Here is Stossel's rebuttal.

WTF?  Sarcasm mixed with political reality over your head?

Are you a TSA agent?  What part of my commentary pushed your buttons?
