He doesn't like Cook. 
being as he was making positive comments about android when jobs was still ceo then nor did he like jobs it seems
wonder how he feels about you ? :O
He doesn't like me either. 
Words are cheap. Let's see Woz waiting outdoor over night for a Lumia launch.
Not a WP fan but I hope MS doesn't kill the product before it has the chance to mature and become popular.
does anyone even really care what woz says anymore? i mean he's like that one guy who just has to stand in line at every new device release just for the heck of it.
I can't believe people still use Windows on smartphones. *cringe*
I've never actually had a chance to use one in person, but so far the screenshots of a bunch of colored boxes or rectangles doesn't strike me as anything special.
sorry but why would any one want a windoz phone.but then some people like to see things crash.
Woz has just done better marketing for Nokia and Windows Phone than they've done for themselves.  They should pay him a large fee.  :-)
The fanboys are in a tizzy over this ....
When I had a Windows phone, it didn't crash, but it didn't do anything particularly well either... and it was a slow resource hog... It was like someone took a desktop OS, put it on a smartphone without any optimization, and hacked on some phone functions just to be able to call it a smartphone.
I might do a little more research on the phone if Woz is backing it. Although I'm still not sold on windows phones just yet. We'll see when windows phone 8 comes out and what sort of cross functionality it will have with it's desktop counter part.
You've just described the *exact* opposite of my experience with WP7...  So much so I honestly cant believe you've used one?  I find it smooth, responsive, minimal (compared to a desktop OS), and this is on the cheapest hardware available.

Oh wait - just realised you are probably talking about old windows mobile?
My phone had 6.5 on it.
