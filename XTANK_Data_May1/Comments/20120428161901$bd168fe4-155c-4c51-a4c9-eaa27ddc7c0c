From what I see the Dem.s seem much more concerned about taking away peoples right to make decisions about their everyday lives.
This just in. Supreme Court rules corporations are people. Which means people have equal protection under the law. A corporation wants my password, they'll have to give me theirs in return.
LOL, good luck on that.
This is beyond asinine. Possibly you might expect to give up your password if you are trying for the job of cheating speculator or the stock market, but not for general jobs

Of course the republicans would take the employers side in this, you are nothing more than something to be taxed
I would ask for an example but Im sure you would just come up with something like"Obama wants my guns"

How do you feel about being little more than someone who fathers babys if the GOP has its way? No birth control?
i think the republic forget the foundation of American Society
