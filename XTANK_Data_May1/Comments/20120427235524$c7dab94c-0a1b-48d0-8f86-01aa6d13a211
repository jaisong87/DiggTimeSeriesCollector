Romney dodges the issue, the coward. Unfortunately Republicans like Romney in Congress are placing top priority on giving tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires instead of making smart investments in education that put the cost of higher education within reach for more Americans.

What Romney fundamentally doesn't seem to understand is that getting a college degree shouldn't be a luxury only a few Americans can afford, and it's the sort of critical investment in our future we should support, not cut. Every hard working student deserves a fair shot at getting the skills and training they need to get a good job and compete in the 21st century economy.

At a time when so many middle class students are struggling to afford a college education, doubling their interest rates will only make it more difficult for them to get ahead.
Hey, that's an awesome idea.  I've been thinking of quitting my job and going back to grad school.  I'll just borrow the money from my mom who lives in the projects.  I'm sure she wouldn't mind going without food for the next 6 years.
