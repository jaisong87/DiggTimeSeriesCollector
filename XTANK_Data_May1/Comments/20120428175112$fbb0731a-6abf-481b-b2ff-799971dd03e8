In a word, "No", some people are totally nuts, more so than in other places, but I could be wrong.
If you're black or mexican I'm sure in the states it does.
Ouch...Ouch...

As a Florida resident, every time someone points to Florida as a source for bizarre crimes, I point to Arizona and say, "It could be worse."
My friend ran my toes over with his truck and it didn't even hurt.  This is insane, I mean, a foreign guy drives down the wrong side of the road, like that's never happened before.  Did he hurt someone else or is the toe lady just making a federal case out of things?

From another article - http://www.usatoday.com/USCP/PNI/Front%20Page/2012-04-27-PNI0426met-norwegian-arrest-PNIBrd_ST_U.htm : "He has a history of aggressive behavior," said Navajo County Attorney Carlyon, whose investigators unearthed police reports relating to John in Alabama, Illinois and California.

Those incidents included threats, an alleged stalking of a young girl, an attempted suicide and a run-in with a Los Angeles bicyclist in which John was accused of running over the man's bicycle in a fit of anger. Not all the incidents resulted in charges, and none resulted in a conviction."
