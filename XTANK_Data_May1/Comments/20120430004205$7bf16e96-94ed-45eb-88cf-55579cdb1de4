Judges get raises while citizens are getting laid off.  And when they don't get raises they get $10,000 extra a year in cash that they don't pay taxes on.  This makes sense how?
how about judge Judy
It's quite simple. Because judges are more important than most people that aren't judges,
What is the problem here? Supreme Court judge is a fairly important position. Those salaries/allowances seem about right to me. Compare with excessive salaries in the private sector.
These aren't supreme court judges.  Quote from the article, "Some judges, like Manhattan Civil Court Judge Jennifer Schecter, spent every last penny."  Jennifer Schecter is not a supreme court judge last I checked...
I was referring to the salaries quoted in the article:  "...salaries for state Supreme Court judges rose to $160,000 this month.."
