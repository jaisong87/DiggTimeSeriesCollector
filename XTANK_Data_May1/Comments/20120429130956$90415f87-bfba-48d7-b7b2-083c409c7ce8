You want to see real crimes, take a close look at this government leadership, those are the true criminals
You really think the ones who are shooting and robbery people actual went into a gun shop and brought a firearm - tell the truth news and stop the lies 
I think they're cherry picking statistics or something, I lived in San Diego for a while and at least at that time there was a significant crime problem (gangs, drugs & robberies).  I don't see this "only 2 injuries & 4 robberies (with firearms)" being truly representative of the crime rate in that city.
take a look at violent crime rates by ethnicity and then you can see the problem.Hispanics being the worst problem.http://digg.com/news/politics/police_chiefs_focus_on_disparities_in_gun_violence
