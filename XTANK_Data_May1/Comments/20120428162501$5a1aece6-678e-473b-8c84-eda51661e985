The study goal was to explore the fundamental question of why people believe in a God to different degrees. The researchers found that religious belief decreased when participants engaged in analytic tasks, compared to participants who engaged in tasks that did not involve analytic thinking. This was true even for devout believers. The cognitive system related to analytic thoughts can influence the combination of factors involved in matters of personal spirituality.
