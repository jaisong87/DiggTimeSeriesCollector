Weapons dating back to WW I?  Those are pretty valuable.  Best wishes to these intrepid explorers.
the pictures don't show anything that isn't modern.
Are those white drip marks on the front of one of them guano?
A truck and an APC hardly constitute a horde of World War weapons.  And given the local populace was using it to grow mushrooms kind of makes it not secret.
There should be a lot of them in Germany as well. From 1945 until 1989 the US military "pre-positioned" military equipment all over Europe, but disproportionately in Germany to prepare for the "coming" Soviet invasion, that of course never came. Given France's distance from the Communist Bloc countries, I seriously doubt that this is an isolated incident.
thats mostly modern except the truck but thats from ww2 .
But does it have sharks with lasers??
