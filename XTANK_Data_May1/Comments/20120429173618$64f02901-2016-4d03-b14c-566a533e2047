Upon reading this, my first thought was a boycott should be organised, with the unfortunate effects that would have on the very crew who already labour under horrible conditions for a pittance.  Has anyone any better ideas?
Shame on you P&O Cruises!

to many cruise companies and those ships are so huge now. One thing is great about cruises because of their competition, consumers can find some great deals. 
long as you don't go to cut-rate and get a Bozo captian who sinks you.

Airlines can use more competition, they charge to much for the packed flights.
This is disgusting. What saddens me is talk here in the States of eliminating minimum wage. I visualize our future in the Titanic-era where class set you apart from the rest of humanity. "You're in steerage? BELOW?"
