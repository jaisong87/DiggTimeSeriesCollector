I am not sure that a company with the gross moral and ethical shortfalls, let alone the crime wave history, of News Corp should even be running a stock index that anyone pays attention to anymore.

Can you get investment advice & financial climate readings from the same place a crime wave comes from?

I don't think so.
When it tangles with industry personalities in an industry where the personalities and individuals themselves ARE the industry, isn't that to be considered Industrial Espionage for gross, crass profits?

Who would not think such an organization would manipulate the truth and them to make a buck?
To be honest, I think that Apple is better than News Corp's DJIA.
