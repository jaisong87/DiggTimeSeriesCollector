In a TV commercial set to flashing, emergency-type lights and grainy pictures of Romney, the ad says job growth in Massachusetts lagged the nation during his tenure and calls a health law he signed "a massive state health care takeover" that served as the blueprint for Obama's health care law. "We just can't trust Mitt Romney," the 30-second ad concludes.
Damn, Santourm is still in the race? 

New and interesting content please.
he loves to say one thing and do another.  A lot more then the average politician
Santourm only 'suspended' his campaign. That means he can take and spend donations, so he did not quit. Many of the others aswell suspended not quit..it's another of those loopholes.
He can still get elected if he spends enough on the spamming of Americans with the paid shit-storms.

Where are the IRS tax returns? where are the state records from the harddrives romney had removed?
