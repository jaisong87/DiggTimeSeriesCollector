Uhhh... this is a double-edged sword.  While I like the fact that we can finally be adults and self-prescribe there's a down side - Blood pressure drugs are tricky things, they're not just "take a pill" and the problem goes away...  Some classes of BP drugs won't work at all on some people and others will work better for entirely different reasons.  You don't want Joe/Jane citizen mowing down on some blood pressure pills because a kiosk suggested it - Likewise with diabetes drugs... some of them will cause low blood sugar which could lead to blackouts... (i assume they're referring to the oral medications and not insulin itself).  On the other hand though, I've had relatives who get stuck with doctors that use the prescriptions as "blackmail" to come back in and pay an exhorbitant office visit fee so he can have his medical tech take the blood pressure before doling out another 3 months worth of generic drugs.
A step in the right direction.
