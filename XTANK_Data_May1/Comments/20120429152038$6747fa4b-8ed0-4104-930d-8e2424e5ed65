I have the Tmobile MyTouch - it's lame.

I think Samsung Galaxy III will be on the list next week.
HTC One X!!!!
The MyTouch series is hardly the top of any class power-wise, but for those of us who don't believe in spending $300+ every two years for a few percentage points of speed, they aren't bad. 
$50 for the phone and a few minutes to root, and there's very little it won't do.
i'm surprised the razr maxx isn't on here. i love it and the battery life is amazing
The HTC One will be frakkin amazing.... I can't wait to trade up from my GalaxyS and tell Samsung to go straight to hell.
