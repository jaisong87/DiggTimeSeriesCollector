Protips: the average user may have 35 apps but not even close to that amount of them transmit data back and forth. Your 'LOL FARTS!' soundboard and calculator app aren't doing this,for example. Only average of 5 or so are transmitting. And your data connection has no effect whatsoever on your voice connection. Also android is built so that apps not in use aren't sucking up your bandwidth. The few apps that do that can be told NOT to. It won't drop your connection either, unless you are in a low connection area.
"And your data connection has no effect whatsoever on your voice connection"

on a CDMA(sprint/verizon) network your phone can only do one or the other. GSM/UMTS(att/tmo) networks can do both at the same time so can phones in a 4g service area with LTE or WIMAX and CDMA but to say "no effect" shows a clear lack of knowledge. 

the majority of people with cellphones are on sprint and big red with CDMA 3g... which means data very much has an effect on voice. if the phone is running well it "should" pause the data connection for a voice call but in the real world it doesnt always work like that. 

the real "tip" is to disregard people who use terms like "protip"
Makes me glad my app only makes connections when the user asks it to
Incorrect. Smartphones have a separate chip for data and voice. I know what I'm talking about. Source: am tech support for verizon.

only if its LTE data and CDMA voice... I said that in my post. in the last 6months you have rolled out this ability to major metro areas. go out side to a zone with out lte and you are stuck with on or the other.

im done repeating myself
Good. No need to keep repeating misinformation.
