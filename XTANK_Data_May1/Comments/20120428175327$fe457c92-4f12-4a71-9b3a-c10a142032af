I'm long past the point of caring. Flying is an ordeal, pure torture. I only do so when it's too far to travel by train.
Airline mergers generally mean less competition. Less competition generally means higher fares and fewer scheduling choices. I wish there was a better way to handle these problems but I don't know what it might be.
Don't really care with all the TSA B.S. ,I won't fly.
