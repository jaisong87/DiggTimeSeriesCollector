socialDynamicsDataCollection/ folder contains a script called diggJob.sh using which you can poll
and collect time-series data every few minutes. 

Use Diggv2.sql to load the mysql schema to your database.

Specify mysql user, passwd, database in the *.py files in socialDynamicsDataCollection/ so that the
script can successfully dump data into your system.

Put diggJob.sh to run and you start seeing  errorLogs and runLogs in the folder. Looking at the errorLog 
you can figure out time intervals for which the script had problems
